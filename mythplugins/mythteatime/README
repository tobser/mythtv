MythTeatime

INSTALLATION:
change into the MythPlugins directory and run

./configure --enable-mythteatime
make
make install


CONFIGURATION/USAGE:
Once the plugin is installed start mythfrontend. The Plugin registers 
a new jump point. Go to "Setup"->"Edit Keys"->"JumpPoints"->"Set a teatimer" 
and assign a key to the "Set a teatimer" JumpPoint and save.

If you press the assigned key a window should popup. Here you can select the 
amount of time until you want to get notified.


KNOWN ISSUES:
 -you can only set the timer while not in playback
 -pausing playback when the timer is elapsed does not work at the moment.
